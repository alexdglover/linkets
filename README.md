# Linkets

App/widget for linking Zendesk tickets. Tickets can be linked together with specific relationships,
like "Blocks", "Is Parent", or simply "Relates to." All linking is achieved by using tags and
client side JavaScript, so your data stays safely within Zendesk. The number of links is only
limited by the tag field constraint of 5096 characters, otherwise there are no limits.

Built with ZAFv2.

"Linkets" is a portmanteau of "linked ticktets."
